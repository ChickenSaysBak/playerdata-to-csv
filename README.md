Converts a Minecraft playerdata folder to a CSV file.
## How to use
1. Download [player-to-csv.jar](https://github.com/ChickenSaysBak/playerdata-to-csv/releases/latest/download/playerdata-to-csv.jar) and run it.
2. Click `Select Folder` and click on the desired playerdata folder. This will be located in the **main world** folder of your Minecraft server folder.
3. Choose which fields you want to export. Note that Username, First Played, and Last Played are not available on vanilla servers; you must have Bukkit, Spigot, Paper etc.
4. Click `Export`, choose the desired output location of the .csv file, and click `Save`.
5. After exporting, the file should open automatically on the default app (usually Excel). This file can be used for things such as populating databases.
